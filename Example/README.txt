NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE WAS DESIGNED FOR USE WITH THE APACHE WEB SERVER!

This is an example of a very basic site that can be made from this MVT framework.

The "MVT" folder is empty to avoid redundancy.

If you wish to see what the example site looks like when browsed, please copy the mvt framework into the "MVT" folder.

In order to browse the page locally, I suggest looking into your web server's directory indexing possibilities.
